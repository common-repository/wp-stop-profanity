Stops Profanity on your site by allowing you to select the words that you want blacked out.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to enter in a set of words that are unacceptable for your site.  If a user either writes a blog post, or comments, this plugin will replace the text with bullets.  The settings page is in the Tools Menu.  There will be more options regarding settings in future releases.  This is a simple way to manage unacceptable words on your site.


== Installation ==


1. Upload `wp_stop_profanity` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Modify settings under the tools menu using "WP Stop Profanity"

Any ideas thoughts about what else this plugin can do is appreciated.  I built this for a client who needed a very simple way to manage profanity on their site in "the_content", "comments_text', and 'the_title' all the time.
